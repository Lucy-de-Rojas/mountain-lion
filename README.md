<h2>How the collage was created:</h2>

<p>
To create a captivating Photoshop collage, I embarked on a creative journey that began with sourcing images online. I scoured the internet for the perfect pictures of a bear, mountain lion, bear cub, rock pick, and a lush forest to bring my vision to life.

Once I had gathered these diverse elements, the real magic began. I meticulously edited each image, paying close attention to details like lighting, colors, and composition. This step was crucial in ensuring that the final collage would appear not only realistic but also seamless.

With the edited images in hand, I began the collage assembly process. It was like piecing together a puzzle, but the reward was a visually stunning scene that told a story. The bear and cub interacting in the forest, with a mountain lion lurking nearby and a rocky terrain to set the stage â€“ it all came together beautifully.

Working on this project was a delightful experience, blending technical skills with creativity. It allowed me to craft a unique narrative through visuals. I look forward to more opportunities like this, where I can continue to explore the limitless possibilities of Photoshop collages.</p>
